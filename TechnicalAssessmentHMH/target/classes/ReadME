INSTALLATIONS:
 
�	Install Java (Preferably Eclipse).

The approach used was:

�	Codification with JAVA using Eclipse, Maven, TestNG.
�      Once the project is imported, for all the dependencies to synchronize correctly you will need to update the Maven project
�	Within src/test /java: you will find the test case package with all the test classes made. 
�	Within the POMP file:  You will find all the dependencies that were considered necessary. 

How to execute the test cases?

If you have already imported the project, have TestNG installed and synchronized Maven, locate the file TestingHMH.xml within
 src/main/ resource. After that, right click on it and select �execute with TestNG�. This will trigger all the test suites created within the test package.
